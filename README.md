# Flappy-Bird
This project comprises mainly of two Python files: flappy.py and flappyunlimited.py, each implementing a version of the popular game Flappy Bird.

File: flappy.py

flappy.py contains the Python code for the classic version of Flappy Bird. In this version, the game ends when the bird collides with any pipe or touches the ceiling or ground. The objective is to navigate the bird through gaps between pipes by pressing space key to make the bird flap its wings and ascend. Players must time their taps carefully to keep the bird airborne and avoid collisions with the pipes.

File: flappyunlimited.py

flappyunlimited.py introduces a variation of Flappy Bird known as Flappy Unlimited. In this version, the game does not end when the bird collides with a pipe. Instead, the game continues indefinitely until the bird either collides with the ground or touches the ceiling. Players have unlimited opportunities to improve their score as they navigate the bird through an endless series of pipes. The challenge lies in maintaining control and avoiding the top and bottom boundaries while aiming for a high score.

Gameplay Instructions:

Controls:
Press space key to make the bird flap its wings and ascend.
Scoring:
In both versions, players earn one point for each pipe the bird passes through without colliding or colliding in case of flappyunlimited.
Game Over:
In flappy.py, the game ends when the bird collides with any pipe or with the ground or touches the ceiling.
In flappyunlimited.py, the game ends when the bird collides with the ground or touches the ceiling.
Project Purpose:

This project serves as a fun exercise in game development using Python and the Pygame library.
It provides an opportunity to practice implementing game mechanics, collision detection, user input handling, and score tracking.
By comparing the classic and unlimited versions of Flappy Bird, developers can explore different approaches to game design and difficulty levels.
Enjoy playing Flappy Bird and Flappy Unlimited, and happy coding!
